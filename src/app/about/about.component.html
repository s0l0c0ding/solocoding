        management engineering and since i discovered my passion in software development and programming, i am a professional full-stack  developer (mainly using Java , Spring framework and TypeScript  Angular framework in enterprise and personal software projects). I have developed and participated in different web apps along the way. I am continuously learning new stuff every day, improving my skills and sharing my knowledge with you.
    </p>

    <p>Iâ€™m a software developer, consultant, architect, coach â€¦ whatever the role, Iâ€™m focused on getting software ready for production.

        The goal of this blog is to persist the things I learned so that you (and future me) donâ€™t have to learn them the hard way (again).
